# 💬 Chattr Messaging App

## 🔌 Backend
The backend uses Node.JS and Express.JS to run a server on port 4040. It uses socket.io to send data in real-time.

## 🖼 Frontend
The frontend was made using next.js and react, and styled with tailwindCSS.

## ⚙️ Usage
There is a Makefile in the root directory.
- Run `make` to install all npm packages for the frontend and backend.
- Go to the api folder and run `npm run start` to start the backend.
- Then, in a different terminal, go to the src folder and run `npm run start` to start the next.js frontend.

You can access the app on localhost:3000
